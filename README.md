# Akkoma-Docker (Unofficial)

[Akkoma](https://akkoma.dev/) (A Pleroma fork) is a selfhosted social network that uses ActivityPub.

This repository dockerizes it for easier deployment.

This repository was heavily based on sn0w's work on [pleroma-docker](https://memleak.eu/sn0w/pleroma-docker)

#### Differences:

* Runs Akkoma instead of Pleroma
* Enviroment variable based configuration
* Autogenerating secrets
* Additional scripts
* Default frontends (pleroma-fe + admin-fe)
